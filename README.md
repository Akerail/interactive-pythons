# Interactive Pythons

Here you can find all my ipython files I ever created or received publicly from someone. They are available for everyone for purpose of learning, experimenting or just having fun :)

## What is and why iPython ?
Extension `.ipynb` stands for "Jupyter notebook" and is almost nothing different from the classical `.py` one. Both are Python codes. Jupyter notebooks just make it easy to capture data workflows: combining Python code, equations(Latex), texts(Markdown) and visualizations. And the most important, it's easy to share them with others!

Jupyter notebooks render in all their glory right here on GitHub. If you want to interact with them (change inputs, re-run,..), feel free to download any file and execute on https://try.jupyter.org/.

For development mode, install Jupyter using pip (Python's package manager):

`python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip`  
`python3 -m pip install jupyter`

or with Anaconda distribution. After that, run Jupyter server with:

`jupyter notebook`

and have fun!
