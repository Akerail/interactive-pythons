# interactive-pythons

Here you can find all my ipython files. `.ipython`extension (standing for Jupyter notebook) is nothing different from the classical `.py` one. Both are Python codes. Jupyter notebooks just make it easy to capture data workflows, combining Python code, equations(Latex), texts(Markdown) and visualizations. And the most important, it's easy to share them with others.  
Jupyter notebooks render in all their glory right here on GitHub.
